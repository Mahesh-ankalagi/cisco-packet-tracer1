# 🌐 Star Topology & WAN – Cisco Packet Tracer  

This repository contains networking projects built in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, demonstrating both **Star Topology** (LAN design) and a **Wide Area Network (WAN)** setup. The projects focus on simulating device connectivity, IP configuration, and packet transmission within and across networks.  

---

## 🔑 Features  
- **Star Topology**: PCs connected to a central switch.  
- **WAN Simulation**: Interconnection of multiple LANs via routers.  
- **IP Addressing** and **basic routing** configuration.  
- Connectivity testing using `ping` and simulation mode.  
- Demonstrates scalability, efficiency, and limitations of both LAN and WAN.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Understand **Star Topology** design and its working.  
- Explore how **WANs connect LANs** across larger distances.  
- Practice configuring **routers, switches, and PCs** in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- Learn packet flow analysis in centralized and distributed networks.
